1.  Preheat oven to 400°F. Place tofu pieces on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Bake tofu for about 35-40 minutes until golden and crisp around the edges, flipping tofu halfway through.
2.  When tofu is almost done, make the sauce. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add garlic, soy sauce, onion powder, brown sugar and sriracha. Add cornstarch and water to a small bowl and mix until cornstarch is fully dissolved. Add the saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil and stir until everything is completely mixed and sauce has thickened. If your sauce is too thick, you can add another 1 tbsp of water to thin it slightly.
3.  Add tofu to saucepan and coat with sauce. Serve while warm. You can serve with rice if desired. You can also garnish with fresh chopped scallions.
